            <h2>What is Separation of Concerns?</h2>
            <p>
                Object-situated writing computer programs is a philosophy for composing a coordinated, strong programs. The center standards of

                OOPS suggest a base degree of association where to compose a program. To overstate the point, you wouldn't

                place your shoes and your food in a similar cabinet would you? You would keep the shoes in the shoerack with

                different footwears while your food would go in the kitchen where all other consumables are stored. Similarly, you wouldn't construct

                a sink in the bedroom and sleep in the garage. In programming, this association of like goes with like is

                what is known as the partition of worries. Like epitome, a program ought to consistently endeavor to isolate

                up work dependent on specific errands.

            <div class="mt-4"></div>
            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>
                This degree of association might appear to be dreary or overemphasized. The significance, notwithstanding, of an efficient and

                elegantly composed program couldn't possibly be more significant. To give a more practical model, I'll allude to the adding machine's document

                structure (displayed over) that has been referenced in past articles. While not displayed in the past models, imagined

                above is the record design of the adding machine's code. Here, you can see an overall mini-computer document, with 2 records

                inside close by a calculator.py record and a __init__.py document. As of now, an overall association construction can

                be seen from the records. The calculator.py record is the fundamental document where basically everything meets up. Further, a

                estimations organizer and a set of experiences envelope can be seen as inside, where the computations' organizer is responsible for the

                math part of the mini-computer and the set of experiences organizer is responsible for the lesser usefulness of the mini-computer.

                This detachment of concern is advantageous particularly for reusing code. Let's assume you are composing one more program with

                mini-computer usefulness. Rather than parsing through scattered documents and refactor code, you would be

                ready to reorder the current envelopes into your new activities, and with little changes to your code, you would

                have the option to reorder your mini-computer in something else entirely.
