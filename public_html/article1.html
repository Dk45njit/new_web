            <h2>PyLint</h2>
            <p>
                Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a
                coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.
            </p>
            <p>

                If you’re coding in Java the compiler will usually lend a helping hand. But if you’re coding in a
                dynamic language like Python you’re on your own: you don’t have a compiler to catch bugs for you.The
                next best thing is a lint tool that uses heuristics to catch bugs in your code. One such tool is Pylint.

        <h2>Glossary of Terms</h2>

        <h3>Constructor:</h3>
        <p>
            Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is to
            initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created.

            In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.
            <!--                •Arrange inputs and targets. Arrange steps should set up the test case. Does the test require any objects or special settings? Does it need to prep a database? Does it need to log into a web app? Handle all of these operations at the start of the test.-->

        </p>
        <h3>Namespace:</h3>
        <p>
            A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every object in Python.

            An object might be a variable or a method. Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python
            dictionary.

            Let’s go through an example, a directory-file system structure in computers. Needless to say, that one can
            have multiple directories having a file with the same name.
            <!--            •Act on the target behavior. Act steps should cover the main thing to be tested. This could be calling a function or method, calling a REST API, or interacting with a web page. Keep actions focused on the target behavior.-->
        </p>
        <h3>Factory Method:</h3>
        <p>
            Factory Method is a Creational Design Pattern that allows an interface or a class to create an object, but
            lets subclasses decide which class or object to instantiate.

            Using the Factory method, we have the best ways to create an object. Here, objects are created without
            exposing the logic to the client, and for creating the new type of object, the client uses the same common
            interface.
            <!--                •Assert expected outcomes. Act steps should elicit some sort of response. Assert steps verify the goodness or badness of that response. Sometimes, assertions are as simple as checking numeric or string values. Other times, they may require checking multiple facets of a system. Assertions will ultimately determine if the test passes or fails. Every major programming language has at least one test framework. Frameworks like JUnit, NUnit, Cucumber, and (my favorite) pytest enable you, as the programmer, to automate tests, execute suites, and report results. However, the framework itself doesn’t make a test case “good” or “bad.” You, as the tester, must know how to write good tests. Arrange-Act-Assert is powerful because it is simple. It forces tests to focus on independent, individual behaviors. It separates setup actions from the main actions. It requires test to make verifications and not merely run through motions. Notice how the pattern is not Arrange-Act-Assert-Act-Assert – subsequent actions and assertions belong in separate tests! Arrange-Act-Assert is a great pattern to follow for writing good functional tests.-->
        </p>
        <h3>Instantiation:</h3>
        <p>
            Instantiating a class is creating a copy of the class which inherits all class variables and methods.
            Instantiating a class in Python is simple. To instantiate a class, we simply call the class as if it were a
            function, passing the arguments that the __init__ method defines. The return value will be the newly created
            object.
            <!--                !&#45;&#45;                •Assert expected outcomes. Act steps should elicit some sort of response. Assert steps verify the goodness or badness of that response.

        <h3>Object:</h3>
        <p>
            Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and
            behaviors into individual objects.

            Objects are like the components of a system. Think of a program as a factory assembly line of sorts. At each
            step of the assembly line a system component processes some material, ultimately transforming raw material
            into a finished product. An object contains data, like the raw or preprocessed materials at each step.
            <!--            •Act on the target behavior. Act steps should cover the main thing to be tested. This could be calling a function or method, calling a REST API, or interacting with a web page. Keep actions focused on the target behavior.-->
        </p>
        <h3>Type Hint:</h3>
        <p>
            Type hinting is a formal solution to statically indicate the type of a value within your Python code.

            It was specified in PEP 484 and introduced in Python 3.5.

            The goal is to provide an easier way to perform a static analysis, potential runtime type checking, and code generation utilizing type information. It is important to note that Python doesn't perform any kind of type checking at runtime.
            <!--                !&#45;&#45;            •Act on the target behavior. Act steps should cover the main thing to be tested. This could be calling a function or method, calling a REST API, or interacting with a web page. Keep actions focused on the target behavior.&ndash;&gt;-->
        </p>
        <h3>Class:</h3>
        <p>
            Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.

            Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.
        </p>
        <h3>Type Cast:</h3>
        <p>
            Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users.

            Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions: int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
        </p>
        <h3>Property:</h3>
        <p>
            The property() method in Python provides an interface to instance attributes.

            It encapsulates instance attributes and provides a property, The property() method takes the get, set and delete methods as arguments and returns an object of the property class.
        </p>
        <h3>Unit Test:</h3>
        <p>
            Unit tests are a special kind of automated test that focuses on testing the least amount of code possible in any one test. Each test tests a single unit of the total amount of available code.

            The Python library for this is called, unsurprisingly: unittest. It provides several tools for creating and running unit tests, the most important being the TestCase class.
        </p>
        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <p>
            A method in python is somewhat similar to a function, except it is associated with object/classes.

            Methods in python are very similar to functions except for two major differences. The method is implicitly used for an object for which it is called. The method is accessible to data that is contained within the class.
        </p>
        <h3>Static:</h3>
        <p>
            A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. A static method can’t access or modify the class state. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.

            we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.
        </p>
        <h3>Design Patterns:</h3>
        <p>
            Design Patterns is the most essential part of Software Engineering, as they provide the general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

            They usually represent some of the best practices adopted by experienced object-oriented software developers.
        </p>
        <p>
           <h5> Classification of design patterns:</h5>
            <li>Abstract Factory Pattern.</li>
            <li>Builder Pattern.</li>
            <li>Factory Method Pattern.</li>
            <li>Prototype Pattern.</li>
            <li>Singleton Pattern.</li>
        </p>
        <h3>Class Method:</h3>
        <p>
            The classmethod() is an inbuilt function in Python, which returns a class method for a given function

            classmethod() methods are bound to a class rather than an object. Class methods can be called by both class and object. These methods can be called with a class or with an object.

            We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method
        </p>
        <h3>Facade Methods:</h3>
        <p>
            Facade Method is a Structural Design pattern that provides a simpler unified interface to a more complex system.

            The word Facade means the face of a building or particularly an outer lying interface of a complex system, consists of several sub-systems. It is an essential part Gang of Four design patterns. It provides an easier way to access methods of the underlying systems.
